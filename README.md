This project involves data scraping using Google search apis, in order to answer questions that start with "who" or "when". When asked a "who" question, all the data strings from websites will be parsed in order to find out any words that look like names, and the most frequent word that comes up will be the answer.

When asked a "when" question, it looks for relevant words such as years, month names (january, february, etc), numbers to find out any relevant dates from the data. The date that comes up most frequently would be the answer.

To do:

Searching with Google Search API

Data Scraping with Beautiful Soup

Regular Expression to parse out relevant data

Frequency Analysis of words

Due 11/23/15
